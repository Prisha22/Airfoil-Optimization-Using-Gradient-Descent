# Airfoil-Optimization-Using-Gradient-Descent

This code is an attempt to explore airfoil optimization using gradient descent.  
It has not yet achieved usable results and was developed to test the optimization algorithm.

## Features
- Uses **PARSEC parameterization**, coupled with **XFOIL** through the `pyxfoil` library.
- Shape updates are made for optimization (requires `pip install pyxfoil`).
- ## Optimization Process
